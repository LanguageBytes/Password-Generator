## Declaring the Variables



##  

var is function scoped and let is block scoped. 


The general idea : 

The variables will be declared at the start. So the possibilities are a set of uppercase, lowercase, special characters. The length could be put in the first order of appearance. The var userSpecification = '' will act as a sort of 'empty basket' the user will then work through and pick the desired 'contents' by answering the questions provided eg include uppercase? The 'Contents' will be added to 'empty basket' to build the criteria for the password. The password will then be created at random based on the criteria the user has selected.
